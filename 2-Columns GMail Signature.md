Signature is at the end of the messages
Present yourself as a professional
Prevent from setting at every computer/mail program
Example of a 2-column signature (tricky!)




GMail / Setting / See All Settings / No signatures (or signatures) / Create New
Name it and Create

The signature editor opens, but with the 1-column default layoutâ€¦.but we want two columns
The tricky is to build a layout of a 2-column signature is to build de 2-column structure at Google Sheets
Only the table structure is leveraged
