`1. GMail / Setting / See All Settings / No signatures (or signatures) / Create New / Name it and Create`
* The signature editor opens, but with the 1-column default layoutâ€¦.but we want two columns.
* The tricky is to build the layout in Google Sheets ... but only the table structure is leveraged.

`2. Go to Google Sheets and create a similar structure`
* Contents in Sheets will not be leveraged...only the layout.
* Column width and line height matter, the layout will be pasted in the editor as it is here.
* The text in Sheets must not be ok when pasted, keep it short and change in the editor.
* Make columns large enough to fit the desired image or text.
* Adjust the image to be ~100x100px.
* Background and border line colors are also pasted, format them in Sheets.
* Copy the two columns and paste in the signature editor.
