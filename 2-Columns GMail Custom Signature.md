`1. GMail / Setting / See All Settings / No signatures (or signatures) / Create New / Name it and Create`
* The signature editor opens, but with the 1-column default layoutâ€¦.but we want two columns.
* The tricky is to build the layout in Google Sheets ... but only the table structure is leveraged.

`2. Go to Google Sheets and create a similar structure`
* The idea is to copy the 2 columns and paste them in the GMail Signature Editor.
* Contents in Sheets will not be leveraged in the signature editor, only the layout (width, lenght, colors, etc).
* The text and image will be replaced (because its format becomes terrible after pasted).
* Column width and line height matter, the layout will be pasted in the Signature Editor as it is in Sheets.
* The text in Sheets must not be ok when pasted, keep it short and change in the Editor.
* Make columns large enough to fit the desired image and text.
* Create an ~100x100px image in local computer.
* Insert the image OVER the cells in Sheets (to keep its size).
* Adjust the margins and alignment of the cell.
* Background and border line colors are also pasted, format them in Sheets.
* Copy the two columns and paste them in the Signature Editor.<br>

* You can include links for social media.
* Logos can bem uploaded or captured from provirders like [this one](https://exclaimer.com/email-signature-handbook/social-media-icons-in-email-signatures/).
* One can use HTML editor like [this](https://html-online.com/) in order to build the signature and then paste the design (not the HTML) into the GMail Signature Editor.
