| * Signature is the text that presents yourself and it is usually placed at the end of messages.<br>* Presents yourself as a professional/person. Fast contact information.<br>* Prevents from setting at every computer/mail computer program.<br>* Example of a 2-column signature (tricky!)         | ![alt text](/assets/img/)         |


GMail / Setting / See All Settings / No signatures (or signatures) / Create New
Name it and Create

The signature editor opens, but with the 1-column default layoutâ€¦.but we want two columns
The tricky is to build a layout of a 2-column signature is to build de 2-column structure at Google Sheets
Only the table structure is leveraged
